# Welcome to XOANI (eXtensible Open framework for Analysis of NeuroImaging)

XOANI is an open framework designed to provide a flexible and extensible platform that supports a broad range of neuroimaging analyses and workflow development. This project aims to deliver a lightweight, scalable solution for managing workloads across general-purpose Docker containers. It features a straightforward command-line execution interface that requires no additional configuration, facilitating pipeline execution on structured datasets, specifically tailored for BIDS datasets.
